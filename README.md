#### Description: Front-end Portofolio with some small projects

Here you can find a portofolio or CV which I have build with JS and CSS,
inside it you can find some small prjects and games that I've built while I am learning.

- Hi there, when you enter portofolio, you will notice that it's only front-end, made by JS and CSS languages.
- You can find sections for some info, previous work positions, education and courses.
- In the last section, you will find some projects I made while I am learning some technologies.
- The most recent one is the Jotto App, it has a secret word, and you should guess this word.
it's made by ReactJS and it's components are tested by Jest and Enzyme.
- I also made a simple calculator of income and expenses by AngularJS.
- I still learning NodeJS and still didn't finish it's project.
- lastely, you will find some games like Rock, Paper, and Scissors, X and O, and Pixel Art Maker.
- Source Code of Jotto App is attached.
